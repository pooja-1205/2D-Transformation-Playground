# 2D-Transformation-Playground
<p> Python-based interactive simulator for visualizing and understanding 2D geometric transformations. This tool allows you to perform various transformations on a 2D shape, such as translation, rotation, scaling, shearing, and custom affine transformations, with live visual feedback.</p>

<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Interactive Console Interface: Choose transformations step-by-step.</li>
<li>Real-time Visualization: Compare the original shape with the transformed shape.</li>
<li>Supported Transformations:</li>
Translation
Rotation
Scaling
Shearing
Custom affine transformations with a user-defined matrix
<li>Simple and Clear Code: Easy to modify and extend for custom applications.</li>
</ul>
